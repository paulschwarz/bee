Ultra-lightweight framework for declaratively binding Javascript behavior to the DOM via HTML.

# Todo
- Usage and examples.
- Allow extension and then provide builds for popular JS frameworks like jQuery and Mootools.
- Set up proper testing.
- Discuss merits of the querySelectorAll method.
- Support IE < 8.
- Rationale (encapsulation, simplification of markup, quality of code, maintainability).
- Metrics (in terms of performance, lines of code saved).
- Credit prior art.
